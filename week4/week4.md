#Week 4

##Take questions (10-20 min)

###Briefly go over searches

##Problems
###Binary Search Recursion
- Draw it out and define the recursive step/base case
- Base case: We find the index OR we step out of bounds
- Recursive Step: Call binary search on subarray
- Code it
- Why log(n)?

###Linked List Palindrome
- Given a singly Linked List, write code to determine if it is a palindrome.
- Iteration: Use slow/fast pointers to push 1st half elements onto a stack and verify
- Recursion: There is a way, but it's pretty tricky (discuss algorithm)
- Linear time

###Reverse a Linked List RECURSIVELY
- Think about base case and recursive call
- When I call reverse on node.next, what do we expect to be returned?
- Think about where the pointers are and how we can manipulate them.

### Is it a BST?
