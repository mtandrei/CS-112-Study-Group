##Problems

###Implement linked list sum (sum of every element in a linked list) and linked list search RECURSIVELY

###Given a linked list, we can have the end of a linked list point to a node in the list, forming a cycle. Write a program to detect if such a cycle exists.

###Given two sorted linked lists, write a program to merge these two lists into a new sorted list RECURSIVELY. Don't allocate any new nodes.
